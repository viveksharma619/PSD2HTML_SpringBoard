                    Sara Weinstein’s graduate education gave her subject knowledge, discipline,
                    and a love of learning. But when switching careers from neuroscience to data science, she found she lacked some other key
                     resources: guidance, accountability, and time. With Springboard’s curated online curriculum and personal attention
                     from her Springboard mentor, she gained the skills and confidence she needed to land her dream job as a data scientist.

                  <h3><strong>I tried learning on my own, and it was overwhelming.</strong></h3>
                  <p>
                    When I started considering Data Science as the next step in my career, I knew there was a lot I needed to learn. I have a PhD in Neuroscience, but as I looked at the descriptions for the jobs I wanted, I realized pretty quickly that I don’t have all the technical skills I needed. </p>
                   <p>
                    I spent over a year trying to learn them on my own. My strategy was to study statistics and machine learning through online courses. But with all the options out there, it seemed overwhelming. There was no way I could complete 8 online courses just to get my foot in the door – I had a full-time job as a research officer for the government, plus two kids to manage too. </p>
                    <p>
                    I kept stalling, until I found Springboard. I loved that they had curated the best content for me, so I didn’t have to wade through everything myself. I’m also someone who does better with a bit of external pressure, and I knew that having a mentor would help me move a lot faster than I’d been able to alone.
